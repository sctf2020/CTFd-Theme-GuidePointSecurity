# CTFd-Theme-GuidePointSecurity
CTFd Theme for GuidePoint Security (Updated a little bit for the newest version of CTFd)

### For Version 2.1.1

## Info
Redesigned CTFd template for [UIKit](https://getuikit.com). Colors are based off of GuidePoint Security themes. Mobile ready. Written by [Alex](https://twitter.com/offsec_ginger) for GuidePoint Security CTF Events.

## Installation
* Copy `guidepointsecurity/` into your `CTFd/CTFd/themes` folder.
* Copy `plugins/challenges/assets/view.html` to `CTFd/CTFd/plugins/challenges/assets/view.html`
* Copy `plugins/dynamic_challenges/assets/view.html` to `CTFd/CTFd/plugins/challenges/assets/view.html`
  * **THIS WILL OVERWRITE THE ORIGINAL. MAKE A BACKUP.**

### TO DO:
- [ ] Maybe redo the Graphs?
- [x] Wait for @ColdHeat to update to 3.0 so I can fix this all over again :stuck_out_tongue:
